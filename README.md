This data depicts the results of an animal study where 250 mice were treated with a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days.
Tumor volume and number of metastatic sites were monitored. Our main objective was to show how four the treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compared. We observed the following: 

1. Over the course of 45 days, tumor volume decreased only in mice that received Capomulin treatment. All other treatments showed an increase in tumor volume. The drugs Infubinol and Ketapril had the similar results to Placebo, indicating that these treatments are not effective in decreasing or even at slowing the progression of tumor size. 
2. Metastatic spread was lowest in Capomulin, with an average number of sites around 1.5 at the end of the 45 day period. Infubinol showed some reduction in metastatic sites, with an average number of sites around 2.2 at the end of the 45 day period. Ketaprill was no better than Placebo at the end of the 45 day period. 
3. Capomulin had the highest survival rates observed at the end of the 45 day period, with roughly 85% suriving. The two other treatments proved to be no better than placebo with roughly 40% suriving in each group. 

Overall, Copomulin showed the most promising results to reduce tumor volume and number of metastatic sites. This drug also showed improved survival.
